            <p> While you scroll through the page that is my personal portfolio you might wonder, "Who is Jalyn Jenkins?". Well... I'll tell ya! Jalyn Jenkins is me!(obviously). While doing this page I wanted the reader to really take a step into my mind, hobbies and interests while also learning a tad bit about the subject that is me. I was born in Columbus, Ohio on January 31st and I'll let you take a ponder on the year. Growing up I enjoyed the outdoors playing every sport that you could imagine baseball, basketball, soccer, football until I finally found the sport that to this day still garners my heart, RUGBY. Along with the outdoors I joined the Boy Scout of America (BSA) at the age of 7 and stayed pretty active in that until my later teens. Doing that provided myself so many more opportunities than I would of had inside my bubble. During the time I was coming of age I really started to dig deep into myself and became obsseded with the vanity that is fashion and sneakers a very expensive choice for a kid with no job. That obsession helped me build relationships with people that are still my very close friends today and pushed me further to actually become the person I wanted to be. Along the way teaching myself a ton of skills including graphic design, sewing, DJing and photography to name a few. Son of a software developer computers kinda run in the blood and it's only right that it was time to dabble my toe in the super deep waters that is software development. During my journey through this process it has been very trying and discouraging at times but I like to leave you with this quote by the late great fashion  desiger Virgil Abloh, "Everything I do is for the 17 year old version of myself".
